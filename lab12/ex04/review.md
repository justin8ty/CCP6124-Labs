1. Which repetition approach is less efficient; a loop or a recursive function? Why?

Recursion is generally less efficient, because of the overhead associated with each function call.

2. When should you choose a recursive algorithm over an iterative algorithm?

When you are dealing with algorithms that requires exploring all possible solutions, such as solving puzzles, involving backtracking.

When the problem is more easily solved with recursion and a better program design is possible.
